## Afterwords

- This is an app that I built to better understand Angular & Rust. Also my first try in Tauri.
- This would be the third Pomodoro App that I build. In comparison to the past 2 apps, this app has the best looks and has the most features so far.
- Of course, this application still contains some tiny issues and can have some enhancements, but it should work as expected.
